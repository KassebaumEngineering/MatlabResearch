     I'm going to send you two files. First, I'll send you
   a testing file of 500 points. Then, I'll send you a
   training file of 3000 points. The benchmark experiments
   were for taking a training set from the beginning of
   the training file. The benchmarks were run for training
   set sizes of 100, 300, 500, 1000, and 3000.

     The file format is a LISP structure, but it is easily
   parsed by a C program. Each line is a separate example.
   The first list on each line is the 4-dimensional input
   vector. The next list is the 1-dimensional output vector.

     I'm really excited to find out how well SONN will do
   on the P=85 problem. I have benchmark data for BP,
   Moody's RBF network, and my RANN network.
